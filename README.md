Getting used to Tensor Flow 2.x

I have been working on Chopin Nocturnes and the Rubber Band Gun and fell behind on Tensor Flow 2.x.

Still want to do the Cartoonify camera and have some new ideas to add. However, I need to get up to speed on Tensor Flow 2.x.

For my own education and amusement I am starting with this Google Colab project:
- https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/object_detection.ipynb

Because the original project used the "Apache License, Version 2.0" I am continuing that.

For my own sanity I am keeping the original file object_detection.ipynb and working on my own version mdo_object_detection.ipynb. I will develop on Google Colab but plan to implement on the amazing Nvidia Jetson Nano (I still have the previous A02 hardware).
